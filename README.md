# IFS LayeredFS

Never repack an IFS again. Full usage instructions available at your forum of
choice.

This code has grown organically and is some of the worst C that I have ever
distributed. The code itself is more or less fine, but the organisation leaves
a lot to be desired. There are many vestigal remains of past AVS experiments.

Built with Visual Studio 2017, but should build with any sane C++ compiler.
Feel free to open an issue if this is not the case.

I encourage pull requests, but might take a while to properly test them prior
to merge. If you can show your PR works with SDVX/IIDX < 24/IIDX >= 25, I will
probably accept it.

Please read the `LICENSE`. It is nonstandard.
